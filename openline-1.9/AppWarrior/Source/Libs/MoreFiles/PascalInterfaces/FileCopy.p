The srcVRefNum, srcDirID and srcName are used to    determine the location of the file to copy.  The dstVRefNum    dstDirID and dstPathname are used to determine the location of    the destination directory.  If copyName <> NIL, then it points    to the name of the new file.  If copyBufferPtr <> NIL, it    points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that is used to copy    the file's data.  The larger the supplied buffer, the    faster the copy.  If copyBufferPtr = NIL, then this routine    allocates a buffer in the application heap. If you pass a    copy buffer to this routine, make its size a multiple of 512    ($200) bytes for optimum performance.        srcVRefNum      input:  Source volume specification.    srcDirID        input:  Source directory ID.    srcName         input:  Source file name.    dstVRefNum      input:  Destination volume specification.    dstDirID        input:  Destination directory ID.    dstPathname     input:  Pointer to destination directory name, or                            nil when dstDirID specifies a directory.    copyName        input:  Points to the new file name if the file is                            to be renamed or nil if the file isn't to                            be renamed.    copyBufferPtr   input:  Points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that                            is used the i/o buffer for the copy or                            nil if you want FileCopy to allocate its                            own buffer in the application heap.    copyBufferSize  input:  The size of the buffer pointed to                            by copyBufferPtr.    preflight       input:  If true, FileCopy makes sure there are enough                            allocation blocks on the destination volume to                            hold both the data and resource forks before                            starting the copy.        Result Codes        noErr               0       No error        readErr             Ð19     Driver does not respond to read requests        writErr             Ð20     Driver does not respond to write requests        badUnitErr          Ð21     Driver reference number does not                                    match unit table        unitEmptyErr        Ð22     Driver reference number specifies a                                    nil handle in unit table        abortErr            Ð27     Request aborted by KillIO        notOpenErr          Ð28     Driver not open        dskFulErr           -34     Destination volume is full        nsvErr              -35     No such volume        ioErr               -36     I/O error        bdNamErr            -37     Bad filename        tmfoErr             -42     Too many files open        fnfErr              -43     Source file not found, or destination                                    directory does not exist        wPrErr              -44     Volume locked by hardware        fLckdErr            -45     File is locked        vLckdErr            -46     Destination volume is read-only        fBsyErr             -47     The source or destination file could                                    not be opened with the correct access                                    modes        dupFNErr            -48     Destination file already exists        opWrErr             -49     File already open for writing        paramErr            -50     No default volume or function not                                    supported by volume        permErr             -54     File is already open and cannot be opened using specified deny modes        memFullErr          -108    Copy buffer could not be allocated        dirNFErr            -120    Directory not found or incomplete pathname        wrgVolTypErr        -123    Function not supported by volume        afpAccessDenied     -5000   User does not have the correct access        afpDenyConflict     -5006   The source or destination file could                                    not be opened with the correct access                                    modes        afpObjectTypeErr    -5025   Source is a directory, directory not found                                    or incomplete pathname        __________        Also see:   FSpFileCopy, DirectoryCopy, FSpDirectoryCopy}{***************************************************************************}FUNCTION FSpFileCopy({CONST}VAR srcSpec: FSSpec; {CONST}VAR dstSpec: FSSpec; copyName: Str255; copyBufferPtr: UNIV Ptr; copyBufferSize: LONGINT; preflight: BOOLEAN): OSErr;{    The FSpFileCopy function duplicates a file and optionally renames it.    Since the PBHCopyFile routine is only available on some    AFP server volumes under specific conditions, this routine    either uses PBHCopyFile, or does all of the work PBHCopyFile    does.
